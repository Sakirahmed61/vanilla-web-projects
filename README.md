### What is this?
- This is all the tiny projects that i've been doing to practice and learn vanilla web development. 
- All the projects you see are made entirely with only HTML, CSS and Js. NO other frameworks or tools are used to create these. 

Thank you [codesistency](https://www.youtube.com/@codesistency) for helping and teaching me the projects.
i've learned a lot from you.
